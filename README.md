The Gaming Room, our client, required a cross-platform game called "Draw It or Lose It" that supports multiple players and sessions simultaneously. The software needed to be scalable, efficient, and provide a consistent user experience across various devices. In developing the software design document, I excelled at detailing the system architecture and specifying clear functional requirements, which helped the team's understanding and streamline the coding phase.

The design document process was instrumental in clarifying requirements and constraints, providing a roadmap that guided development and anticipated potential challenges. If I could revise one part, it would be to simplify the database schema for easier maintenance.
